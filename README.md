# BlackjackCpp-RL

A project where I code the popular casino game of Blackjack in C++. I've coded it using object oriented programming (OOP), taking advantage of OOP concepts such as constructors, inheritance and composition. We then use reinforcement learning to try and learn the optimal strategy for Blackjack - in particular we will use the Monte Carlo control algorithm and the Q learning algorithm. 

# Set up 

In our implementation we play using only 1 deck of cards, where as in casinos nowadays they will use around 6-8 decks shuffled together to negate the effect of card counting.
